## Project Overview
This project explores shortest path algorithms using Python. The goal is to implement, analyze, and compare several algorithms, both on synthetic and real-world data, with a focus on correctness, efficiency, and practical applications.

**Algorithms implemented:**
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm (with k-relaxation)**  
- **Bellman-Ford Algorithm (with k-relaxation)**  
- **All-Pairs Shortest Path**  
- **A\* Algorithm**

**Real-world dataset:** London Subway Network, with stations as nodes and connections as edges. Edge weights are computed using geographical distance between stations.
